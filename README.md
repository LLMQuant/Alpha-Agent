## AlphaAgent Overview

AlphaAgent is designed to harness the power of AI and machine learning for financial markets. It integrates multiple agents working in tandem to analyze data, implement strategies, combine insights, and test their efficacy in simulated environments.

## Components

### Alpha Mining Agent

The Alpha Mining Agent is responsible for extracting valuable insights from large datasets. It uses various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and generate trading signals.

### Implementation Agent

The Implementation Agent takes the signals generated by the Alpha Mining Agent and executes trades based on predefined strategies. It ensures that the trades are carried out efficiently and effectively.

### Combination Agent

The Combination Agent merges the outputs of multiple agents to create a cohesive strategy. It optimizes the combined signals to maximize returns while managing risk.

### Backtesting

Backtesting is a critical component that tests the strategies in a simulated environment using historical data. It helps in assessing the performance and robustness of the trading strategies before they are deployed in live markets.


## Very first steps

### Initialize your code

1. Initialize `git` inside your repo:

```bash
cd alphaagent && git init
```

2. If you don't have `Poetry` installed run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

> This installs Poetry as a [standalone application][fs1]. If you prefer, install it through your distribution's package manager.

3. Initialize Poetry and install `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

4. Run the codestyle:

```bash
make codestyle
```

5. Upload initial code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m ":tada: Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/llmquant/alphaagent.git
git push -u origin main
```
