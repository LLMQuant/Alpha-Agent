**AlphaAgent** is a practical and adaptive multi-agent framework for real-world quantitative research and development. Built upon the principles of [RD-Agent(Q)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15155), it emphasizes **production-grade alpha discovery**, **market-aware modeling**, and **automated deployment**, leveraging live data streams, evolving knowledge bases, and robust backtesting infrastructure.

## üåê Core Objectives

AlphaAgent enables:
- Continuous mining and curation of high-value factor/model ideas from domain knowledge sources
- Dynamic retrieval of strategies that align with real-time market characteristics
- Self-refinement of hypotheses using prior experiments and contextual relevance
- Code generation, error correction, and backtest integration with minimal human intervention
- Automatic research documentation and decision support outputs for industrial use

## üîÅ System Pipeline

The full pipeline operates in a continuous feedback loop:

1. **Knowledge Base Construction**  
   Extract alpha factor and model ideas from large-scale research reports and academic papers via [`LLMQuant/quant-wiki`](https://github.com/LLMQuant/quant-wiki).

2. **Market Feature Extraction**  
   Continuously monitor financial news and macroeconomic updates via [`LLMQuant/MarketPulse`](https://github.com/LLMQuant/MarketPulse) to characterize market regimes (e.g., volatility, liquidity, sentiment, momentum).

3. **Contextual Retrieval & Hypothesis Generation**  
   Match current market regimes with relevant strategies from the internal knowledge base. Use similarity scoring and prior backtest records to refine retrieved hypotheses or generate novel ones.

4. **Code Synthesis**  
   Translate structured hypotheses into executable Python code using Co-STEER-style reasoning and knowledge transfer. Support chain-of-thought debugging and structured error recovery.

5. **Live Backtesting**  
   Deploy generated strategies into a Qlib-based real-time backtest pipeline. Evaluate under transaction cost, slippage, sector neutrality, and dynamic rebalancing conditions.

6. **Research Report Generation**  
   Summarize each experiment into human-readable research reports with metric tables, charts, diagnostics, and improvement suggestions.

> üöß AlphaAgent is under construction ‚Äî exciting features and demos are coming soon. Stay tuned!
